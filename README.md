# CliAi
A shell assist powered by ChatGPT

**CliAi** is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows you to interact with the ChatGPT language model easily. It is designed to run in three different modes: chat, one-shot, and file. Additionally, it supports code colorization in the response to enhance readability.



## Features
**Chat mode**: Engage in a real-time conversation with ChatGPT.
**One-shot mode**: Get an instant response by providing an input.
**File mode**: Process input from a file or the result of another shell command.
**Code colorization**: Automatically colorizes code in the response for better readability.
**Setup script**: A setup.sh script to install dependencies and create a cli_ai command in the shell.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- An API key for ChatGPT

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Heydarchi/CliAi.git
cd CliAi
```
Run the setup script to install dependencies and create the cli_ai command:
```
./setup.sh
```
On the first run, you will be prompted to enter your ChatGPT API key.

## Usage
### Chat Mode
To start a chat session with ChatGPT, simply run the following command:
```
cli_ai chat
```
You can then interact with ChatGPT by typing your messages and pressing Enter.

**Note**: You can exit the chat session by typing **exit** or **quit**.

### One-Shot Mode
To get an instant response from ChatGPT, use the following command:
```
cli_ai one-shot "Your question or prompt here"
```
### File Mode
To process input from a file or the result of another shell command, use the following command:
```
cli_ai file input.txt "Message 1" "Message 2" "Message 3"
```
Replace input.txt with the path to your input file, and provide additional messages as arguments after the file name.
